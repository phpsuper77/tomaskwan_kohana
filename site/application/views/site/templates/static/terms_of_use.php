GymHit reserves the right to decide whether Postings are appropriate and comply with this Agreement in its sole discretion.  This Website may provide links to other websites or resources over which GymHit does not have control (“External Websites”). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by GymHit of those External Websites.

Your use of External Websites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies (if any) located on the linked to External Web sites, and is at your own risk.  Certain other websites may link to this Website.  You may provide links to this Website from your own website as long as you do not use any GymHit trademarks, and do not link to this Website by any means that gives visitors to your own website the impression that you are linking to pages that are within your own website, or that GymHit endorses your website, sponsors your website, or is in any way affiliated with your website.  You shall not attribute a link on your website to this Website and then link somewhere else.  You may not “frame” any portion of the Website or present any portion of the Website as belonging to you or any third party.

                    <p>VII. Term.</p>

                    <p>VIII.    Limitation of Liability.</p>
                    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL GYMHIT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER AND WHEREVER ARISING.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GYMHIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR REGARDING THE SOFTWARE OR THE WEBSITE EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1000).  Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of damages so the foregoing may not apply to you.</p>
                    <p>IX.  Law and Arbitration.</p>
                    <p>This Agreement shall be subject to the laws of the State of California as apply to contracts entered into and performed in California between California residents and without regard to conflicts of laws principles.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, before a single arbitrator who shall be selected in accordance with such rules.  The location of the arbitration shall be San Diego, California, and the fee of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Subject to the foregoing, the State and Federal courts located in San Diego, California, shall have sole jurisdiction over any dispute arising hereunder, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed.</p>
                    <p>X.   Disclaimer.</p>
                    <p>GYMHIT PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE, THE WEBSITE AND ALL GOODS AND SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  GYMHIT HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEAL, USAGE OR TRADE, AND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR TITLE.  Some jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of certain warranties, so the foregoing may not apply to you.</p>
                    <p>XI.  General.</p>
                    <p>Neither this Agreement, nor any rights hereunder, may be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, by you without the prior, written permission of GymHit.  Any purported assignment without such permission shall be void.  This Agreement may be assigned by GymHit in whole or in part without notice.  Any waiver of any rights of GymHit under this Agreement must be in writing, signed by GymHit, and any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of any future breach of this Agreement.  In the event any portion of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining terms shall be separately enforced.  Your use of the Website shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to this subject matter, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous or additional communications, negotiations or agreements with respect thereto.  You agree that: (a) the Website shall be deemed solely located in California; and (b) the Website is and shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over GymHit, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.  YOU AND GYMHIT AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
